Cosmic Guardian is a unity space flight simulation game where the player pilots a spaceship in some galaxy. The spaceship has to dodge or destroy different obstacles in its way in order to finally battle against other hostile spaceships. Shooting at celestial bodies and land mines earns the spaceship power droplets which it needs to move through the portal to the next galaxy (i.e., level) before reaching the final galaxy and destroying enemy spaceships there.

# Controls & Game Interactions
The spaceshipâ€™s movement can be controlled using WASD (preferably) or arrow keys, and the mouse or touchpad. And shooting is done by left clicking. And space and left ctrl for going upwards or downwards. Also, the spaceship can roll using Q and E keyboard keys.
The player has to be aware of his surroundings so that a mine or a spaceship does not attack him or her. He or she also has to shoot with the help of the cursor, and be able to follow it to the portal when enough power is mustered.
Power level and the cursor will be visible at all times in gameplay.
