Cosmic Guardian is a unity space flight simulation game where the player pilots a spaceship in some galaxy. The spaceship has to dodge or destroy different obstacles in its way in order to finally battle against other hostile spaceships. Shooting at celestial bodies and land mines earns the spaceship power droplets which it needs to move through the portal to the next galaxy (i.e., level) before reaching the final galaxy and destroying enemy spaceships there.
